This repository contains a simple Python command-line implementation of the "Snake, Water, Gun" game, similar to "Rock, Paper, Scissors."

How the Game Works:
Snake (S) defeats Water (W) - (Snake drinks water)
Water (W) defeats Gun (G) - (Water rusts the gun)
Gun (G) defeats Snake (S) - (Gun shoots the snake)
Features:
The player can choose between Snake (S), Water (W), or Gun (G).
The computer randomly selects its choice.
The game compares the player's choice with the computer's to determine the winner.
Input validation ensures that only valid choices (S, W, G) are accepted.
Usage:
Run the script and input your choice when prompted. The game will then display both your choice and the computer's choice, followed by the result of the match.
